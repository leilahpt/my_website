      <description>The GDP data we will look at is from the United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars and it has already been saved in the Data directory.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Leilah and I&amp;rsquo;m a Masters in Financial Analysis student at London Business School. My interest in coding originated a few years ago during an internship in asset management, where I learnt VBA to modify a stock-selection model in Excel. I loved the job and ever since, I have been trying to expand my repertoire of coding languages. The purpose of this website is to showcase examples of code I have created during my university assignments.</description>

      <description>Let’s visualise the risk and return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks. Besides the thirty stocks that make up the DJIA, we will also add SPY which is an SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).
We will use the rvest package to scrape the Wikipedia page for the constituents of DJIA
djia_url &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average&amp;quot; #get tables that exist on URL tables &amp;lt;- djia_url %&amp;gt;% read_html() %&amp;gt;% html_nodes(css=&amp;quot;table&amp;quot;) # parse HTML tables into a dataframe called djia.</description>

      <description>The Guardian newspaper has an election poll tracker for the upcoming German election. We will replicate this graph. The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at Wikipedia.
The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.
