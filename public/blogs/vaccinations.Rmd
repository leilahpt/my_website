In this short blog, we will reproduce a chart of vaccination levels against the proportion of a state's population who voted for Trump using updated data. The chart we wish to reproduce is available [here](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have). 

1. To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh) 
1. We will use [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
1. Finally, we also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)
 

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# Download CDC vaccination by county

cdc_url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
vaccinations <- vroom(cdc_url) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(fips != "UNK") # remove counties that have an unknown (UNK) FIPS code

# Download County Presidential Election Returns
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ
election2020_results <- vroom(here::here("data", "countypres_2000-2020.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  
  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data
#population_url <- "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232"
population <- vroom(here::here("data", "PopulationEstimates.csv")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=Attribute, values_from=Value) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  
  # select the latest data, namely 2020
  select(fips = fip_stxt, population_2020) %>% 
  
  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))

```

First we clean the elections data.

```{r}

#MODIFYING THE ELECTIONS DATASET

#Viewing the election dataset
glimpse(election2020_results) 
head(election2020_results)

#Checking the possible election candidates
election2020_results %>% 
  select(candidate) %>% 
  unique() #We can see that Trump has been entered as 'DONALD J TRUMP'

#Cleaning the elections data
elections_clean<-election2020_results %>% 
  filter(mode=="TOTAL",candidate=="DONALD J TRUMP") %>%
  select(fips, candidatevotes, totalvotes) %>%  #Keeps only the required columns
  mutate(pct_trump=candidatevotes/totalvotes*100) %>% #Calculates the percentage of votes for Trump
  select(-candidatevotes,-totalvotes) #Now we have only fips and percentage of votes for Trump

```

We next clean the vaccinations dataset and view the populations data.

```{r}

#MODIFYING THE VACCINATIONS DATASET

glimpse(vaccinations)
head(vaccinations)

vaccinations %>% 
  group_by(fips) %>% 
  summarize(date_count=n_distinct(date)) #There are multiple dates associated with each FIPS region. We need to select the latest date.

#Cleaning the vaccinations data
vaccinations_clean<-vaccinations %>% 
  filter(date=="09/22/2021") %>% #Keeps the latest data (from 22nd September 2021)
  mutate(
    prop_vaccinated=case_when(
      recip_state %in% c("CA", "GA", "IA","MI", "TX") ~ administered_dose1_pop_pct,
      TRUE ~ series_complete_pop_pct
      ) #Uses administered doses for CA, GA, IA, MI, TX, an approach adopted by the chart we are aiming to replicate. Uses completion percentage for the remaining states.
  ) %>% 
  select(fips, prop_vaccinated, recip_county, recip_state) #Keeps only the fips, the proportion of the population who are vaccinated and area data.
  
```


```{r}

#VIEWING THE POPULATION DATASET
glimpse(population)
head(population)

#We will map population_2020 to the size of the circles in the ggplot graph.

```

Finally we merge the datasets and make the plot of vaccination rates against the percentage who voted for Trump. You will notice that there are several counties who have reported that 0% of their population is vaccinated; perhaps these counties chose not to report their data. As a result, we plot a second graph which omits the 0% vaccination rates.
```{r}

#MERGING THE DATASETS AND MAKING THE PLOTS

#Joining the datasets by FIPS
merged_data<-elections_clean %>% 
  left_join(population, by="fips") %>% 
  left_join(vaccinations_clean, by="fips")
