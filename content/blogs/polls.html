<p>The Guardian newspaper has an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor">election poll tracker for the upcoming German election</a>. We will replicate this graph.
The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The following code will scrape the Wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>url &lt;- &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election&quot;

# get tables that exist on wikipedia page

  slice(2:(n()-1)) %&gt;%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)

<p>Next we plot the graph of poll results over time. The solid lines depicted here represent the 14-day rolling average of the election polls.</p>
