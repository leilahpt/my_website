The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6).


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <- read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xlsx"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip 

```

The first thing we need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and we will make it into long, tidy format. We express all figures in billions and rename the indicators to make them shorter.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=`1970`:`2017`,names_to="year") %>% 
  mutate(value=value/1e9,
         IndicatorName=case_when(
           IndicatorName=="Final consumption expenditure"~"Final expenditure",
            IndicatorName=="Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)"~"Household expenditure",
            IndicatorName=="General government final consumption expenditure"~"Government expenditure",
            IndicatorName=="Gross capital formation"~"Gross capital formation",
            IndicatorName=="Gross fixed capital"~"Fixed capital",
            IndicatorName=="Gross fixed capital formation (including Acquisitions less disposals of valuables)"~"Fixed capital formation",
            IndicatorName=="Exports of goods and services"~"Exports",
            IndicatorName=="Imports of goods and services"~"Imports",
            IndicatorName=="Gross Domestic Product (GDP)"~"GDP",
            IndicatorName=="Agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing (ISIC A-B)"~"Farming",
            IndicatorName=="Mining, Manufacturing, Utilities (ISIC C-E)"~"Mining, Manufacturing, Utilities",
            IndicatorName=="Manufacturing (ISIC D)"~"Manufacturing",
            IndicatorName=="Construction (ISIC F)"~"Construction",
            IndicatorName=="Wholesale, retail trade, restaurants and hotels (ISIC G-H)"~"Trade & services",

            IndicatorName=="Other Activities (ISIC J-P)"~"Other",
            IndicatorName=="Total Value Added"~"TVA"

         )
  )

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```


```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 9}

tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list,
         IndicatorName %in% c(
                          "Gross capital formation", 
                          "Exports",
                          "Government expenditure",
                          "Household expenditure",
                          "Imports"
                          )
         ) %>% 
  mutate(IndicatorName=factor(IndicatorName, 
                              levels=c("Gross capital formation", 
                                      "Exports",
                                      "Government expenditure",
                                      "Household expenditure",
                                      "Imports"
                              )
                        )
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(year),
             y=value, 
             color=IndicatorName
          )
  )+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="GDP components over time",
       subtitle="In constant 2010 USD",
       x="",

  scale_color_discrete(name="Components of GDP")+

```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in our data frame, we calculate it given its components discussed above.

```{r}
GDP_data<-tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list,
         IndicatorName %in% c(
                          "Gross capital formation", 
                          "Exports",
                          "Government expenditure",
                          "Household expenditure",
                          "Imports",
                          "GDP"
                          )
         ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=IndicatorName,
              values_from=value) %>% 
  mutate(GDP_estimate=`Household expenditure`+`Government expenditure`+`Gross capital formation`+Exports-Imports)

```


We calculate the % difference between GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe:

```{r}

#Table of percentage differences and their absolute values
pct_diff<-GDP_data %>% 
  mutate(
    pct_diff=(GDP_estimate-GDP)/GDP*100,
    abs_pct_diff=abs(pct_diff) #Calculates the absolute value of the percentage differences
    ) %>% 
  select(-c("Gross capital formation", 
            "Exports",
            "Government expenditure",
            "Household expenditure",
            "Imports"
          )
        )
pct_diff

#Summary statistics of the absolute percentage difference for each country
favstats(abs_pct_diff~Country,data=pct_diff, na.rm=TRUE)

```

> In all three countries, household expenditure is the largest component of GDP and the lowest is net exports. While household expenditure has been decreasing in Germany and India as a proportion of GDP, it has been increasing in the US. Germany is the only country which has experienced a relative increase in net exports. Since 2000, the proportion of India's GDP attributed to gross capital formation has significantly increased, reflecting India's later economic development.
