Hi, I'm Leilah and I'm a Masters in Financial Analysis student at London Business School. My interest in coding originated a few years ago during an internship in asset management, where I learnt VBA to modify a stock-selection model in Excel. I loved the job and ever since, I have been trying to expand my repertoire of coding languages. The purpose of this website is to showcase examples of code I have created during my university assignments.

### Why R?
You may be wondering why I started learning R rather than Python. During my undergraduate degree in Economics, I developed an interest in statistics and econometrics, and so decided to pursue a career as an actuary. I had to learn the basics of R in preparation for the first actuarial exam and then decided to take an elective in machine learning for R to develop my knowledge further. However, now that I know R to an intermediate level, I plan to next learn Python.
