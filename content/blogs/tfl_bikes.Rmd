In this blog, we will look at how many TfL bikes are hired every day, and the excess rentals over time.

We get the latest data by running the following:

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# Change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```


We create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.We also look at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. 

For both of these graphs, we calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. 

```{r}

bike %>% 
  group_by(month, year) %>% 
  summarise(
    actual_rentals=mean(bikes_hired, na.rm=TRUE)
    ) %>% 
  ungroup(year) %>% 
  mutate(
    expected_rentals=mean(
                          subset(actual_rentals,year>=2016 & year<=2019),
                          na.rm=TRUE
                        ),
   excess_rentals=actual_rentals-expected_rentals,
   up = ifelse(actual_rentals>expected_rentals, excess_rentals,0),
   down = ifelse(actual_rentals<expected_rentals, excess_rentals,0)
        ) %>%

In the dataset, some points from January 2021 have been classified as week 53. Were we to plot this on the chart, the point would appear on the far right of the chart rather than at the start of 2021. Our chart removes these datapoints to avoid this issue
