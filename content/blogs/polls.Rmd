The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor). We will replicate this graph.
The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election).


The following code will scrape the Wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.


```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"

# similar graphs and analyses can be found at 
# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor
# https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )
```


Next we plot the graph of poll results over time. The solid lines depicted here represent the 14-day rolling average of the election polls.
```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=7}

# We define the x-axis as the end date of the survey
# We assign each party a color and make the points see-through
